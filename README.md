# Advent of Code: 2022

This repository will contain exercises from advent of code 2022.

This year, I decided to participate in AoC whilst attempting to learn the Haskell programming language.

Each directory is named after that day's challenge. In each are files `1.*` and `2.*` which correcspond the the first and second parts of the challenge, respectively. Each may contain a solution in JavaScript, Haskell, or both. The challenge's input is in `input.txt`.

## Execution
- Haskell: `runghc <n>.hs`
- JavaScript: `node <n>.js`
