# Advent of Code: 2022

This repository will contain exercises from advent of code 2022.

This year, I decided to participate in AoC whilst attempting to learn the Haskell programming language.

## Structure
These files will always be present. Additional support files may also be present.

- `<day>/`
  - `hs/` - Haskell solution source code
    - `1.hs` - Challenge part 1
    - `2.hs` - Challenge part 2
  - `js/` - JavaScript solution source code
    - `1.js` - Challenge parts 1
    - `2.js` - Challenge parts 2
  - `inputSample.txt` - Challenge sample input
  - `input.txt` - Challenge input

## Execution
Source code is intended to be executed **from the same directory as the source file**.

- Haskell: `runghc <n>.hs`
- JavaScript: `node <n>.js`
