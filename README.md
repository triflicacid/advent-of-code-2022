# Advent of Code: 2022

This repository will contain exercises from advent of code 2022.

This year, I decided to participate in AoC whilst attempting to learn the Haskell programming language.

## Structure
- `<day>/`
  - `1.js` - Challenge parts 1, Haskell
  - `1.hs` - Challenge parts 1, JavaScript
  - `2.js` - Challenge parts 2, Haskell
  - `2.hs` - Challenge parts 2, JavaScript
  - **Optional** `Funcs.hs` - Haskell utility functions, as many are shared between parts.
  - **Optional** `Funcs.js` - JavaScript utility functions, as many are shared between parts.
  -- `inputSample.txt` - Challenge sample input
  -- `input.txt` - Challenge input

## Execution
- Haskell: `runghc <n>.hs`
- JavaScript: `node <n>.js`
